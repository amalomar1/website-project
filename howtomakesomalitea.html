            <h1>How To Make Somali Tea</h1>
        <p> Step 1</p> 
        <p>To start, put a medium sized pot on the stove on medium to high heat. Once you have poured water into the pot, allow the water to boil. While the water is boiling, get a mortar and pestle (if you do not have a mortar and pestle, you can use a spice grinder). Put the cardamon, cloves and cinnamon in the mortar and pestle and crush it until it becomes ground. If you are using the spice grinder, grind it until it becomes ground. The add the spices to the boiling water.</p>
        <p>Step 2</p>
        <p>the ginger root into 1/4-inch thick pieces. Working with a few pieces at a time, smash the ginger in a mortar and pestle until all pieces are smashed (you can also smash with a meat tenderizer or a kitchen mallet). Add the ginger to the water, followed by the sugar and tea, and bring to a boil.</p>
        <p>Step 3</p>
        <p>The last step would be when the ingredients has boiled together, you turn off the stove. You leave the pot still on the stove and allow the remaining heat to penetrate the pot and leave it there for at least 15 mins. After the 15 mins are complete, you get a strainer and put it on top of the cup. You finish it off by adding in milk, but you also do not have to have milk.</p>
